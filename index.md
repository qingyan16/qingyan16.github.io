I am currently Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. My research spans statistical methods and applied clinical/epidemiogloic studies. My methodological research lies at the intersection of causal inference and machine learning. My applied work includes both randomized trials and observational studies, with focuses on infectious diseases, aging, and pain.
